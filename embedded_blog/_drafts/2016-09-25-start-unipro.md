title: Dwelving into UniPro
---

Since the first notions of modular smartphones became aware to me, it got apparent to me that these concepts would be a good if not better fit for other products.
Now we notice that this concept did not work out for smartphones (with Project ARA being cancelled) but I still believe that it is a great opportunity in other fields.

# Past developments

There were multiple projects in the past, which tried to bring modularity to Smartphones. In my opinion, the most notable are:
- [Project ARA](https://atap.google.com/ara/)
- [Fairphone 2](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/)
- [PuzzlePhone](http://www.puzzlephone.com/)

Looking at all the available options, it seems like ARA was the only general purpose approach out there. This is mainly due to being based on [UniPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniPro).

# UniPro

For those not having heard about UniPro just yet, it basically provides high-speed networking connections.

## Usage

Now as far as I could find out there were only usages of UniPro.

- Parts of UniPro might be used in UFS 2.0. Sadly searching for the UFS 2.0 spec one only finds the [press release]( https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-publishes-universal-flash-storage-ufs-standard-v20) with a defunct link to the standards document. 

- Project ARA was destined to use UniPro

Should I not have missed any other usage, it seems like the end of Project ARA also marks a problematic point. As of now there does not seem to be anyone too invested in this technology.

## Getting started

Getting started with UniPro is not easy though since it is being developed by the MIPI Alliance. The only way of getting access seems through membership for thousands of euro.
