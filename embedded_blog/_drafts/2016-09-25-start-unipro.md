title: Dwelving into UniPro
---

Since the first notions of modular smartphones became aware to me, it got apparent to me that these concepts would be a good if not better fit for other products.
Now we notice that this concept did not work out for smartphones (with Project ARA being cancelled) but I still believe that it is a great opportunity in other fields.

# Past developments

There were multiple projects in the past, which tried to bring modularity to Smartphones. In my opinion, the most notable are:
- [Project ARA](https://atap.google.com/ara/)
- [Fairphone 2](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/)
- [PuzzlePhone](http://www.puzzlephone.com/)

Looking at all the available options, it seems like ARA was the only general purpose approach out there. This is mainly due to being based on [UniPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniPro).

# UniPro

For those not having heard about UniPro just yet, it basically provides high-speed networking connections.

Getting started with UniPro is not easy though since it is being developed by the MIPI Alliance. And the only way of getting access seems through membership for thousands of euro.

Now it seems to me like the only people actually using UniPro were ARA. So I am kind of wondering

The end of Project ARA also marks a problematic point. In the current situation it is not clear who will further invest in the technology.
